    """Epoch the raw eyetracking data.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    raw : array, shape (n_times, 3)
        Raw eyetracking data. The first column contains the event messages.
        The second and third columns contain the eye positions in the x- and
        y-dimensions, respectively.
    info : instance of `ScreenInfo`
        Eyetracking acquisition information.
    events : array, shape (n_trials, 3)
        Events data. Each row represents a trial. The first column
        denotes the block. The second column denotes the trial onset
        relative to the block. The third column denotes the trial length.
    template : str
        Template for block start note as found in the EyeLink output file.
    
    Returns
    -------
    epochs : array, shape (n_trials, n_times, 2)
        Epoched eyetracking timeseries data. Last dimension is the
        spatial dimension of the eyetracker (xdim, ydim).
      
    Notes
    -----
    Designed for the FHTconfidence dimensions task dataset collected 
    by Angela Radulescu & Julie Newman. Key assumption is that each 
    "Start of Run message" is aligned to the first stimulus onset 
    within that run/block.
